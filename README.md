## A decentralised social graph

Swish is a simple project to create a decentralised social graph using the ActivityPub https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/

Swish is based on NodeJS

### The Concept

The social graph is based on decentralised nodes connected to each other loosly based on the ActivityPub guideline

One of the drawbacks of traditional centralised social networks such as Facebook and Twitter is the fact that the owners of the network can owns your content, and data, they are selling your data to advertisers. These centranlised networks can also delete your account, disable them, that can remove your content from the internet in an instant.

Not only that because these networks are tied to a single domain name or IP, governments can easily censor your content and block access.

However a decentralised social netowrk can solve all of these issues,

When you download and host your copy of the **Swish** framework, you are creating a single node. This single node can now connect to various other nodes (other hosted copies of the **Swish** framework or other decentralised netowrk based on ActivityPub) on the internet to create a decentralised network.

Here you own your data, because data stays at your node, because the network is not attached to a single point (domain), it can't be sensored by government, and no one can delete or remove your account, unless you delete your own node.

### What's next?

I created this project as a hobby for the 2021, and work is still in progress, please follow the repo for further updates
